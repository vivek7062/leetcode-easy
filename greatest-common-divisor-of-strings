// Question - https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/
// Answer in cpp


If is there any substring which devide to both string then alwayes will be str1+str2 == str2+str1 otherwise we will return ""

As we can see we need to return maximum length substring
Ex. str1 = ABABAB , str2 = ABAB

If we take ABAB then if we devide str1 then AB will be remaining so we can't take ABAB so now we are taking only AB that will complete devide our both strings.

So we are take GCD because we need to find maximum length of substring which will devide both string length completly so our answer string lenght will be GCD(len1,len2).

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(LogN)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code
class Solution {
public:
    string gcdOfStrings(string str1, string str2) {
        return str1+str2==str2+str1?str1.substr(0,gcd(str1.size(),str2.size())):"";
    }
};
