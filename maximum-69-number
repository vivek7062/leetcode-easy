1. Question - https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-69-number/
2. Answer in cpp

Approach
Just traverse number from right to left if we found 6 then convert to 9 and if we found again 6 then convert to 9 and make previous number 6 by subtracting pow(10,last)*3 where last is that counter of number from last where we did change number 6 to 9 priviouly.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(Log(n))

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code
class Solution {
public:
    int maximum69Number (int num) {
        int ans=0,count=0,rem,last=0,flag=0;
        while(num){
            rem = num%10;
            num/=10;
            if(rem==6){
                if(flag) ans-= (pow(10,last)*3);
                last=count;
                rem=9;
                flag=1;
            }
            ans = pow(10,count)*rem + ans;
            count++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
